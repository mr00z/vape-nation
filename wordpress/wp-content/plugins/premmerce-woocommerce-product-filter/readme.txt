== The only Filter Plugin that have all you need SEO Settings ==

**Generating pages with the Clean URL**
Generating pages with the Clean URL based on the selected category + brand + attribute (you can specify an unlimited number of attributes)

**Creating landing pages based on filters (Premium)**
[Premmerce WooCommerce Product Filter Premium](https://premmerce.com/premmerce-woocommerce-product-filter/) allows you to create landing pages based on the choice of filter configuration. The rule that generates these pages consists of the following elements:

Category (you can choose any category in the store for which the attributes are assigned) + Brand (if our Premmerce WooCommerce Brands plugin is activated) + Product Attribute / Attributes (you can choose any number of attributes and their terms).

This way you’ll create landing pages for already filtered pages of products with a specified category, brand, and attributes. For example, the following pages can be created:

Smartphones (category) + Apple (brand) + 7S (attribute) + Gold (attribute) + 64 Gb (attribute)

And for this page you can specify a unique h1, title, meta description and SEO-text.

**Bulk generation of landing pages (Premium)**
If you have many categories, brands, and product attributes in the store, it’s quite challenging to create unique descriptions of all possible options of categories + brands + attributes.

However, in order to get as many pages of your store as possible available in the search result, you can still generate a number of pages with Clean URL and unique titles.

**Automatic adding of pages to the Sitemap  (Premium)**
After the category filters optimization, it is important to let the search crawlers know that now you have many more landing pages than before. So, when you create a page based on filters either manually or automatically, the plugin automatically adds new pages to the Sitemap, which is generated by the Yoast SEO plugin.

== Themes’ Support ==
The plugin supports all most popular WooCommerce themes as  we’ve optimized styles to fit the most popular solutions, provided a  filter style “turn off” option in order to enable the styles of the chosen theme.
